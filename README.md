ðŸ“§ Email Data Analysis using Poisson Distribution

Welcome to the **Email Poisson Distribution Analysis Project**!  
This project models the number of emails received per day using **Poisson Distribution** â€” a powerful statistical tool to predict the probability of a number of events happening in a fixed interval.

---

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Collect data of emails received by multiple persons over a week.
- Calculate the **average rate (Î»)** of emails per day.
- Apply the **Poisson probability formula** to find the likelihood of receiving exactly `k` emails on a given day.
- Visualize the probability distribution using graphs.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **NumPy** (Numerical calculations)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- **SciPy** (Poisson Distribution from stats module)

ðŸ“š Statistical Concept: Poisson Distribution

The **Poisson Distribution** models the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval, provided the events happen independently at a constant average rate.

**Formula:**  
\[
P(X = k) = \frac{Î»^k e^{-Î»}}{k!}
\]

Where:
- \( Î» \) = Average number of emails per day (mean)
- \( k \) = Specific number of emails we want to find the probability for

ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow

1. Dataset of emails received per day is loaded for multiple persons.
2. Overall average number of emails (`Î»`) is calculated.
3. User inputs any value of `k`.
4. Program computes:
   - Probability \( P(X = k) \)
   - Percentage chance
5. A beautiful bar graph of the Poisson distribution is displayed.
